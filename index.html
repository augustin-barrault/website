    <h1>To Be or Not To Be</h1>

    <div class="text-section">
        <p>
            To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
            Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
            The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
            Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
            And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;<br>
            No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
            The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
            That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br>
            Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
            To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br>
            For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
            When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
            Must give us pause: there's the respect<br>
            That makes calamity of so long life;<br>
            For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
            The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
            The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br>
            The insolence of office and the spurns<br>
            That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
            When he himself might his quietus make<br>
            With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br>
            To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
            But that the dread of something after death,<br>
            The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br>
            No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br>
            And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
            Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
            Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br>
            And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
            Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
            And enterprises of great pitch and moment<br>
            With this regard their currents turn awry,<br>
            And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!<br>
            The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br>
            Be all my sins remember'd.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
            Shall we endure, or choose the rest<br>
            In sleep or death, find peace at last?<br>
            Shall we confront the mortal fray,<br>
            And break from sorrowâ€™s cruel sway?<br>
            Or lie in dreams, in shadows deep,<br>
            Where souls unshackled freely sleep?<br>
            For what we face upon this earth,<br>
            Is that which ends in hollow mirth.<br>
            Shall we endure or boldly strive,<br>
            In mortal plight, our souls alive?<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh conscience sharp, a two-edged sword,<br>
            Reminding us of all accord,<br>
            The sins, the pain, the lingering doubt,<br>
            The paths not chosen, cries left out.<br>
            Thus are we made by thoughts restrained,<br>
            By all the woes that we've sustained.<br>
            To sleep, to dream, yet fear's embrace<br>
            Persuades us to a slower pace.<br>
            And thus, the day continues on,<br>
            While silent fades the light of dawn.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            To bear, or break, 'tis not so clear,<br>
            With shadows deep and doubt so near.<br>
            And so, we pause, we hesitate,<br>
            Caught in the threads of our own fate.<br>
            But soft, I end this endless quest,<br>
            And seek my peace, a final rest.<br>
        </p>
